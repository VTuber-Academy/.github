# Welcome to VTA Github!
This is where we host our back-end and front-end code for future development projects! This is to encourage VTubers that are also developers to help contribute VTA make tools and resources to help the VTuber community!

# Projects ü§ñ
Here is our future project plans that are all pretty exciting and think will help the VTuber world! Most of these are being led by [@Mieko Hikari](https://github.com/MiekoHikari) but everyone is open to contribute aslong as they follow each repo's respective rules! Each project has its actual name and it's used name in () to differentiate the development and production environment in a fun way (for me).
## Amari (VTA Bot)
- Amari is a discord bot aimed to aid the [VTA discord community](https://discord.gg/vta) perform efficient back-end operations and engage the community with fun interactions!
- It is planned to have [VTuber, Artists, Staff] Applications, ModMail, Silent Levelling, Radio, and many more...
- It is built with the sapphire.js framework (node.js) with additional components that ensures TDD
- Links: Not Available yet.
## PrimeStar (VTA Lexicon)
- Not an approved project yet, hopefully planned soon!

# Open Source Contributions ‚úçÔ∏è
Everyone is free to contribute to the repos we have to offer aslong as you follow their respective rules! All new implementations require an approval from all VTA Staff so if it takes longer than usual to accept your changes, don't fret!

###### _Fun Fact: The code for doing the cat is hidden somewhere in the repository_
